# Exercise 4 - Identity Provisioning Operations - Manage Transformations

In this exercise, we will learn about the various Operations available in the Identity Provisioing service.

**Transformations**
For every system supported by the Identity Provisioning service, there is an initial (default) transformation logic that converts the system specific JSON representation of the entities from/to one common JSON. This default transformation is visible on the Transformations tab when you create a new system, after saving it. 

**Transformation Editors**
The Identity Provisioning service provides two editors for working with the transformation code: graphical editor and JSON (text) editor. The graphical editor is displayed by default. You can switch between them on the Transformations tab as we will see in the next exercise. 

## Exercise 4.1 Meet the graphical editor

Last executed job ran on an error. In this case, the reason was that the value for the department in the source system does not match the possible value in the target system. The scope of this exercise is to understand how to use the grphical editor, therefore we will perform a mapping between the possible values of the department attribute.  

1. From your SCI admin console navigate to the third tab Target Systems. We want to perform the value mapping in the target system because these values are specific to the Identity Directory target system specific.
